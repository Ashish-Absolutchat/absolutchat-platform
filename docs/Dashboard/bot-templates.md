# Bot Templates

## Create Flows

There are 2 ways you can create new flows:

1. Set up a bot and create flow for the bot. (create from blank or template)

2. Install a template as a sole flow.

Visit ourÂ [template store here](https://www.absolutchat.app/settings/accounts/5116#/templates)

:::caution WARNING
When you just install a template without connecting it to any bot. You are unable to test the flow.
:::

## Create Templates

A template is created from one of your existing flows and the flow thereafter becomes the source flow of the template.

:::danger WARNING
Source flow is important if you need to edit/update the template in the future. Make sure you keep and mark it safely.Â ***If you accidentally delete it, you cannot edit the template anymore***. Try to unlock and install the template to be a new source flow and re-create a template with that source flow.
